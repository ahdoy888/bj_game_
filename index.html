    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>In Blackjack, you are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face down and one face up. The goal of Blackjack is to get closer to 21 points than the dealer without going over 21 points.

    A “Blackjack” is a hand that totals 21 points with two cards. BJ automatically wins, unless both you and the dealer receive BJ, then you push. A total of 21 points with three or more cards is not considered BJ.</p>
    <p>
      To Win:
      You get Blackjack.
      Your hand is closer to 21 points than the dealer’s hand and does not exceed 21 points.
      The dealer’s hand exceeds 21 points while your hand does not exceed 21 points.
        
      How the Dealer Plays:
      
      Dealer Hits on any total of 16 or less
      Dealer Stands any total of 17 or more
